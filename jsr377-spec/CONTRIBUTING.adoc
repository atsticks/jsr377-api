= Contribution Guidelines

We love to see contributions to the project and have tried to make it easy to
do so. If you wish to contribute documentation, then please keep to the following
guidelines to ensure consistency within the sources and that we have happy users.

== Guidelines

 . A single page per chapter. This allows reviewers to have a quick glance at the
 whole content without having to browse additional files.
 . Please insert a blank line at the top and at the end of each document. This allows
 inclusion of files without adding so much white space in between. For example, without
 these blank lines one would have to write the following to include two files
....

include::chapter1.adoc[]

include::chapter2.adoc[]

....
 
 where as adding the blank lines removes the need to define them in the including document

....
include::chapter1.adoc[]
include::chapter2.adoc[]
....
